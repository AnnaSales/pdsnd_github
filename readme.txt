I used the following page to help with datetime objects (especially extracting hours and month and day):  https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.time

I used https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html for general reminders on how to work with pandas series and dataframes

I used https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_dict.html to remember how to convert a Series to a python dict.
